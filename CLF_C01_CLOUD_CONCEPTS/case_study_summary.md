CASE STUDY For organizations moving to cloud from on-premise and cloud value framework:

 Key Findings
– A survey of companies spending $100,000 or more annually on public cloud shows that 80%
exceed their cloud budgets in most months. Yet 95% of respondents agree that using cloud
services reduces the TCO for IT infrastructure when compared with on-premises equivalents.
- Unit costs for public cloud infrastructure have stayed low even as macroeconomic inflation has
reached historic highs. Our research finds that cloud buyers are spending the money they save by
moving to cloud on new services to improve productivity and derive new revenue, not necessarily
to reduce costs.
- Businesses implementing cloud financial management practices report that their efforts are most
likely to result in greater cloud adoption, higher revenue and improved profitability.
- Based on the results of our survey, best practices for cloud cost control include: using the full
range of available services (infrastructure, platform and software); taking advantage of the
full range of pricing models available (on-demand, reserved instances, savings plans and spot
instances); allocating costs in a way that is meaningful in business terms, whether via account
management, resource tagging or chargeback/showback; and ensuring that financial management
is in the hands of teams with both ownership and accountability for cloud spending.
- IT teams are the primary drivers of cloud financial discipline for more than half of organizations,
but this responsibility can change depending on the degree of spending, with the duty shifting to
platform and finance teams at higher levels.
- IT teams are also very involved in setting sustainability goals: 86% of the organizations in our
sample have a formal sustainability program in place; of those, 71% report that IT is very involved in
setting and meeting sustainability goals.

Q. For what time period do you forecast your cloud spending?
Base: All respondents (n=959).
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022.
“[Our ability to manage and control cloud costs] is pretty good because we reexamine it every month. 
We produce these cost optimizations. We produce capacity reports and utilization reports. 
So I think you control it by providing the data, cost, performance, capacity availability. And if you provide the data, then
make it digestible by the managers and the finance people, then it drives the behavior.”

“The serverless database options… are compelling from a cost standpoint.
You go out and pay for what you use and grow as you need. So I haven’t
heard any complaints about the database cost.”

100,000+ employees, $10B+ revenue, Food, beverage & agriculture

Q. Which of the following pricing models does your organization use to purchase cloud resources today?
Q. Which role in your organization is primarily responsible for implementing cloud financial management (CFM) practices?
Base: All respondents.
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022.
Allocate Costs in a Way That Is Meaningful in Business Terms,
Whether Via Account Management, Resource Tagging or
Chargeback/Showback
“[For public cloud pricing] we use chargeback models. So we set up
accounts in the clouds and then they get charged back… and we take
percentages out for like management and for the different groups that
have to be involved… We’re constantly evaluating how can you reduce
your cost in public cloud; for example, can we move you from Windows
to Linux, or can we put in long-term contracts for one year or even three
years of consumption, you get lower rates.”
IT/engineering manager/staff
100-249 employees, $25M-$49.99M revenue, Government

Q. Which role in your organization is primarily responsible for
implementing cloud financial management (CFM) practices?
Base: All respondents (n=1,000).
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022

* The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:

- Stop guessing your capacity needs: With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.
- Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources.
- Automate with architectural experimentation in mind: Automation permits you to create and replicate your workloads at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort.
- Consider evolutionary architectures: This permits systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.
- Drive architectures using data: Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.
- Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production.

* The pillars of the framework 
** Operational excellence 
- Perform operations as code: You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their run process by initiating them in response to events.
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes: Design workloads to permit components to be updated regularly. 
- Refine operations procedures frequently: Set up regular game days to review and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them.
- Anticipate failure: Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated.
- Learn from all operational failures: Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures.
** Security 
- Implement a strong identity foundation: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources.
- Maintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection with systems to automatically investigate and take action.
- Apply security at all layers: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls
- Automate security best practices: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost-effectively. 
- Protect data in transit and at rest: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.
- Keep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.
- Prepare for security events: Prepare for an incident by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your organizational requirements.
** Reliability  
- Automatically recover from failure: By monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can start automation when a threshold is breached.
- Test recovery procedures: In an on-premises environment, testing is often conducted to prove that the workload works in a particular scenario. Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies.
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability: Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload.
- Stop guessing capacity: A common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload
- Manage change in automation: Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation.
** Performance efficiency  
- Democratize advanced technologies: Make advanced technology implementation smoother for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor.
- Go global in minutes: Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world permits you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
- Use serverless architectures: Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities.
- Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.
- Consider mechanical sympathy: Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns with your workload goals.
** Cost optimization  
- Implement Cloud Financial Management: To achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, invest in Cloud Financial Management and Cost Optimization.
- Adopt a consumption model: Pay only for the computing resources that you require and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements, not by using elaborate forecasting.
- Measure overall efficiency: Measure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivering it.
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting: AWS does the heavy lifting of data center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers. 
- Analyze and attribute expenditure: The cloud makes it simple to accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then permits transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners.
** Sustainability   
- Understand your impact: Measure the impact of your cloud workload and model the future impact of your workload.
- Establish sustainability goals: For each cloud workload, establish long-term sustainability goals such as reducing the compute and storage resources required per transaction.
- Maximize utilization: Right-size workloads and implement efficient design to verify high utilization and maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware.
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings: Support the upstream improvements your partners and suppliers make to help you reduce the impact of your cloud workloads.
- Use managed services: Sharing services across a broad customer base helps maximize resource utilization, which reduces the amount of infrastructure needed to support cloud workloads. 
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads: Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services.
