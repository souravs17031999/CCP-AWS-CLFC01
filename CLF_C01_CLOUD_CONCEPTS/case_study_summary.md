CASE STUDY For organizations moving to cloud from on-premise and cloud value framework:

 Key Findings
– A survey of companies spending $100,000 or more annually on public cloud shows that 80%
exceed their cloud budgets in most months. Yet 95% of respondents agree that using cloud
services reduces the TCO for IT infrastructure when compared with on-premises equivalents.
- Unit costs for public cloud infrastructure have stayed low even as macroeconomic inflation has
reached historic highs. Our research finds that cloud buyers are spending the money they save by
moving to cloud on new services to improve productivity and derive new revenue, not necessarily
to reduce costs.
- Businesses implementing cloud financial management practices report that their efforts are most
likely to result in greater cloud adoption, higher revenue and improved profitability.
- Based on the results of our survey, best practices for cloud cost control include: using the full
range of available services (infrastructure, platform and software); taking advantage of the
full range of pricing models available (on-demand, reserved instances, savings plans and spot
instances); allocating costs in a way that is meaningful in business terms, whether via account
management, resource tagging or chargeback/showback; and ensuring that financial management
is in the hands of teams with both ownership and accountability for cloud spending.
- IT teams are the primary drivers of cloud financial discipline for more than half of organizations,
but this responsibility can change depending on the degree of spending, with the duty shifting to
platform and finance teams at higher levels.
- IT teams are also very involved in setting sustainability goals: 86% of the organizations in our
sample have a formal sustainability program in place; of those, 71% report that IT is very involved in
setting and meeting sustainability goals.

Figure 5: Monthly forecasting is most common
Q. For what time period do you forecast your cloud spending?
Base: All respondents (n=959).
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022.
“[Our ability to manage and control cloud costs] is pretty good because we reexamine it every month. 
We produce these cost optimizations. We produce capacity reports and utilization reports. 
So I think you control it by providing the data, cost, performance, capacity availability. And if you provide the data, then
make it digestible by the managers and the finance people, then it drives the behavior.”
IT/engineering manager/staff 100-249 employees, $25M-$49.99M revenue, Government

“The serverless database options… are compelling from a cost standpoint.
You go out and pay for what you use and grow as you need. So I haven’t
heard any complaints about the database cost.”
IT/engineering manager/staff
100,000+ employees, $10B+ revenue, Food, beverage & agriculture

Q. Which of the following pricing models does your organization use to purchase cloud resources today?
Q. Which role in your organization is primarily responsible for implementing cloud financial management (CFM) practices?
Base: All respondents.
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022.
Allocate Costs in a Way That Is Meaningful in Business Terms,
Whether Via Account Management, Resource Tagging or
Chargeback/Showback
“[For public cloud pricing] we use chargeback models. So we set up
accounts in the clouds and then they get charged back… and we take
percentages out for like management and for the different groups that
have to be involved… We’re constantly evaluating how can you reduce
your cost in public cloud; for example, can we move you from Windows
to Linux, or can we put in long-term contracts for one year or even three
years of consumption, you get lower rates.”
IT/engineering manager/staff
100-249 employees, $25M-$49.99M revenue, Government

Q. Which role in your organization is primarily responsible for
implementing cloud financial management (CFM) practices?
Base: All respondents (n=1,000).
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 2022
Our survey shows that ownership of the
cloud financial management function
rests primarily with IT teams (see Figure 6);
this finding is consistent across spending
levels. In most organizations, IT teams are
responsible for both budgetary discipline
and cloud resource positioning

Q. How involved is the IT team in setting/meeting your organization’s sustainability goals?
Base: Organizations with a sustainability program in place (n=861)
Source: 451 Research custom survey, 202
IT teams are top
contributors to the effort: 71% of those with sustainability goals cite IT as
being very involved in setting and meeting those goals

Q. Which of the following software tools do you currently use or plan to use to measure, monitor and manage sustainability
improvements?
Base: Organizations with a sustainability program in place (n=793).

* The Business Value of Adopting Amazon
Web Services (AWS) Managed Databases

- 13% reduction in the costs of licenses/subscriptions associated with databases
• 68% improvement in analytic query execution time
• 51% reduction in unplanned downtime
• 53% reduction in database administration
• 38% increase in developer productivity associated with database-related tasks

* AWS Cloud Value Framework

** Cost Savings (TCO)
50%+ reduction in TCO.
- GE Oil & Gas is migrating 500 applications to the cloud by the end of 2016 as part of a major digital transformation, 
helping it attain a 52 percent reduction in TCO. GE Oil & Gas is a business unit of global conglomerate General Electric, 
with energy-related operations around the world. The company's cloud migration project entailed reexamining—and in many cases, 
eliminating—legacy processes, resulting not only in lower IT costs but also in greater speed to market and more agility to compete 
even better in an industry experiencing immense market challenges. 

** Staff Productivity
Over 500 hours per year of server configuration time saved.
- Sage company 

** Operational Resilience
Critical workloads run in multiple AZs and Regions for robust DR.
- Expedia Group is all in on AWS, with plans to migrate 80 percent of its mission-critical apps from its on-premises data 
centers to the cloud in the next two to three years. By using AWS, Expedia Group has become more resilient. 

** Business Agility
Launch of new products 75% faster.
- Unilever: Deploying new features/ applications faster and reducing errors

** Sustainability
Minimizing environmental impact of business operations
- Power consumption reduced by 10 megawatts per year.
-  In fact, according to a 451 Research report, the AWS infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median of the surveyed US enterprise data centers, and AWS operates at an 88% lower carbon footprint.
- CapitalOne company   

The business value of migrating to AWS to learn how migrating on-premises infrastructure to AWS achieves quantifiable business value such as:

69% decrease in unplanned downtime
20% cost savings in technology infrastructure
29% increase in staff focus on innovation
